# Examples

The example directory, contains different modern cpp-idioms, to use qemu-lib. 
As QEMUlib aspires, to be used in a modern cpp-context, and allow integration
with different libraries through message-passing, these examples serve as a
test-bed for qemulib as well. 

Additional test-harnesses will be added, in the future as complexity and compatibility
issues aries as a result of added possibilites.
